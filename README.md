Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a class should have only one reason to change. Consider a User class in a web application. Initially, this class may handle user authentication, user profile management, and email notifications. However, as the application grows, each responsibility becomes complex and intertwined. By applying SRP, we can refactor the User class into smaller, more focused classes: one for authentication, another for profile management, and a separate one for email notifications. This way, each class has a single responsibility, making the codebase more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to bugs. For instance, if the email notification logic needs to be updated, we only need to modify the EmailNotificationService class, without affecting other parts of the system.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
The Dependency Inversion Principle emphasizes that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes directly; instead, they should depend on abstractions. Consider a logging system where a Logger class directly depends on a specific logging library. Applying DIP, we can introduce an ILogger interface that defines common logging methods. Now, the Logger class depends on ILogger, allowing us to switch between different logging libraries without modifying the Logger class. For example, we could implement ILogger for both console and file logging, providing flexibility and decoupling between the Logger class and specific logging implementations. This abstraction also facilitates easier testing by allowing us to mock ILogger during unit tests.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
The Interface Segregation Principle asserts that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Imagine a DocumentEditor interface in a word processing application with methods for editing text, formatting, and spell checking. However, some clients, such as a spell checker module, may only need access to the spell checking functionality. By adhering to ISP, we can break down the DocumentEditor interface into smaller, more specialized interfaces, such as ITextEditor and ISpellChecker. This allows clients to depend only on the interfaces relevant to their needs. For instance, the spell checker module can now depend solely on ISpellChecker, avoiding unnecessary coupling with methods it does not use. This segregation of interfaces promotes cleaner design, enhances code maintainability, and prevents unintended dependencies between components.
